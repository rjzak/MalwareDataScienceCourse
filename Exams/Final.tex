\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Define malware.
    \begin{itemize}
        \tick Malicious \textit{intent} against computer \textit{owner}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Define conceptual drift.
    \begin{itemize}
        \tick Over time, the malware changes, the malware authors change, so the features used, and the relationship between the features, will also change.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item When would you want to use dynamic analysis over static analysis?
    \begin{itemize}
        \tick When the malware is packed and/or encrypted.
        \tick Malware is complete, it simply downloads another part which does further malicious behavior.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Why would it be acceptable to use AUC instead of accuracy as an acceptable metric for model performance?
    \begin{itemize}
        \tick A very high AUC means the accuracy was high too.
        \tick A high AUC shows that the model was able to accurate sort the files by malicious vs. benign.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item For our purposes, why shouldn't a tool which might be used by a hacker, such as a port scanner, be considered malware?
    \begin{itemize}
        \tick We can't know the \textit{intent} of the user of the tool, and the author of the tool didn't \textit{intend} for malicious usage.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item When might it be too difficult, or impossible, to create a Yara rule for a given malware family?
    \begin{itemize}
        \tick Malware family used different packers, or is otherwise not part of common source code.
        \tick Malware which is supposedly related, but having different characteristics, used for different things, but maybe attributed to a common attack, APT, or threat actor.
    \end{itemize}

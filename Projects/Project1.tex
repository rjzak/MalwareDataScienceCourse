\section*{Project 1}
\paragraph{}Research and present to class a tool, product, software library, method, algorithm, or concept you believe would aid in the analysis of malware as a data science discipline. The item presented and discussed must be something which exists, not speculation or concept which isn't usable. Example: don't describe a magical tool which decrypts/unpacks malware, but doesn't actually exist.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Perhaps a new way to group related malware in a cluster?
    \item Maybe a tool you've discovered which reduces entropy by unpacking/decrypting malware samples?
    \item It could be a software package or product for dynamic analysis of malware to get different features not otherwise available.
\end{itemize}

The paper and/or presentation should include the following talking points:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What problem does it solve?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is the problem?
        \item How is the life of an analyst, security engineer, or data scientist improved by working on this problem (the ``so what?'' factor)?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Is the item available today?
    \item Does the item cost money? What's the return on investment (ROI)?
    \item What's the learning curve for using the proposed product or solution?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Points:} 50

\section*{Format}
\paragraph{}Pick a format you prefer.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Slide deck to present to class, 3 - 5 slides.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Maybe a sales pitch?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Paper, 2 or 3 pages, and have something to discuss with the class (demo, prepared statement, etc).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Submission}
\paragraph{}Submit the material(s) via Blackboard.

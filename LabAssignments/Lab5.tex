\section*{Lab 5 - Cross Validation}
\paragraph{}Included in the virtual machine is a collection of malware which is part of Endgame's Ember dataset. Using the provided code, build several models based on the entirety of the data, using cross validation to select the best model. The import for Endgame's feature creator is \texttt{from features import PEFeatureExtractor} \attachfile{Lab5/features.py}.

\textbf{Points:} 20

\section*{Questions}
\paragraph{}In a separate document, provide your answers to the following questions. The expected format is a Word document, or similar, with a few images demonstrating your progress. The assignment will be submitted via Blackboard.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item About how many files ended up in the training and testing datasets?
    \item Did you see any errors when running the scripts? Anything mentioning \texttt{lief}? What do you think causes that error? What is \texttt{lief}?
    \item What were some of the features used by Endgame for Ember? How many features where there in total?
    \item What is the overall accuracy of the best model, and how did it compare with the other models?
    \item Try another algorithm in the \texttt{sklearn} toolkit. How does that algorithm's performance differ? By which metric do you measure this performance?
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Don't forget to include screenshots.
\end{itemize}

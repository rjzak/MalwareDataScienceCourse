\section*{Final Lab: Feature Engineering}
\paragraph{}Good science, and the scientific method, are about reproducability in experiments. In their paper, \textit{Feature Selection for Malware Detection Based on Reinforcement Learning} \attachfile{Papers/Malware_Feature_Selection_Reinforcement_Learning.pdf}, Fang, Z., et al discuss domain-specific features and specific machine learning algorithms used, along with achieved accuracy results. Using the same features, and the malware samples we've been using this semester, try to reproduce their results from their paper.

\textbf{Points:} 50\\
\textbf{Reminder:} This is part of the final exam.

\section*{Questions}
\paragraph{}In a separate document, provide your answers to the following questions. The expected format is a Word document, or similar, with a few images demonstrating your progress. The assignment will be submitted via Blackboard.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Which features seem to be the most discriminative?
    \item Which machine learning algorithm was most effective?
    \item Where they any difficulties you encountered recreating their results?
    \item How many files did you use as part of the training/testing split?
\end{itemize}

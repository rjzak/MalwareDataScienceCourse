\section*{Lab 13: Automated Yara Signatures}
\paragraph{}The purpose of this Lab is to create Yara rules for malware families using an automated method. Provided are Bloom Filters which represent $n$-grams of different sizes in goodware and malware. Pick three malware families from the Ember 2018 dataset, and create Yara rules for them by finding $n$-grams which are common to members of the family, but not present in the Bloom Filters. Use Yara to test the resulting Yara rule by making sure it catches malware in the family, doesn't catch malware in other families, and doesn't catch any goodware. Spot check the other malware families and goodware, you're not expected to test everything.

\textbf{Points:} 40

\section*{Questions}
\paragraph{}In a separate document, provide your answers to the following questions as well as your Yara rules. The expected format is a Word document, or similar, with a few images demonstrating your progress. The assignment will be submitted via Blackboard.

\begin{itemize}
    \item What difficulties, if any, did you encounter?
    \item For which malware families did you make rules?
    \item For each rule family, what was your false positive rates (malware from other families your rule caught, goodware your rule thought was malware)?
    \item For each rule, did it have any false negatives?
    \item Did you find any malware families where you couldn't make a rule? If not, speculate on why this automated Yara rule creation task may fail to create a usable rule.
\end{itemize}

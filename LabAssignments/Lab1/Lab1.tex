\section*{Lab 1: Introduction to Ghidra}
\paragraph{}The purpose of this Lab is to briefly introduce you to Ghidra \& basic concepts of traditional malware analysis. You are not expected to be an expert in reverse engineering, or to be proficient with assembly language. Instead, the purpose is to show the contract between malware analysis versus malware data science.

\textbf{Points:} 10

\section*{Questions}
\paragraph{}In a separate document, provide your answers to the following questions. The expected format is a Word document, or similar, with a few images demonstrating your progress. The assignment will be submitted via Blackboard.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Open Ghidra, what do you see?
    \item What type of file is it?
    \item What does the program do?
    \item What is the difference between the three executables? How do you know?
    \item How do you trigger the secrets?
    \item How is the second secret hidden from the \textit{strings} command?
    \item Which tools did you use to examine the executables?
    \item Open \texttt{pi} and \texttt{pi\_upx} in Ghidra. What's the difference?
    
    \item Don't forget to include screenshots.
\end{itemize}

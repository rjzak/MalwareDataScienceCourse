\section*{Lab 12 - PDF/RTF Malware Models}
\paragraph{}Building from Lab 10 on $n$-grams, create a model with \texttt{xgboost} which detects PDF \& RTF malware. This would result in a separate model for each file type. Use \texttt{shap} to see which features were important.

\textbf{Points:} 20

\section*{Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
    %\item Write a script to break the data into separate training and testing directories, with an 80\%/20\% split. You should use symbolic links instead of copying the files, since it will save disk space. In Python: \texttt{os.symlink(existingFilePath, newLinkPath)}.
    \item Make a dataset in CSV format, with headers.
    \item Use \texttt{Pandas} to read the CSV file as a dataframe.
    \item Train the model.
    \item Evaluate on the test data.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Questions}
\paragraph{}In a separate document, provide your answers to the following questions. The expected format is a Word document, or similar, with a few images demonstrating your progress. The assignment will be submitted via Blackboard.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What was the highest accuracy score you were able to achieve?
    \item Were you able to make the model(s) without code changes?
    \item How many, and what value of $n$ did you use for your $n$-grams?
    \item What troubles or difficulties did you encounter, and how did you resolve them?
    \item What were some of the PDF artifacts the $n$-grams found? (PDF structure, JavaScript, etc)
\end{enumerate}

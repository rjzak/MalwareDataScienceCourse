\section*{Lab 1: Introduction to Ghidra}
\paragraph{}The purpose of this Lab is two-fold: to ensure that you are able to run the provided virtual machine on your laptop, and to briefly introduce you to Ghidra \& basic concepts of traditional malware analysis. You are not expected to be an expert in reverse engineering, or to be proficient with assembly language. Instead, the purpose is to provide a starting point malware \& data science, so that at the end of the semester, you can look back and see how far we've progressed.

\textbf{Points:} 5

\section*{Questions}
\paragraph{}In a separate document, provide your answers to the following questions. The expected format is a Word document, or similar, with a few images demonstrating your progress. The assignment will be submitted via Blackboard.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Virtual Machine questions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Which version \& distribution of Linux is on the virtual machine?
        \item What is the IP address of the virtual machine?
        \item What steps would you take to ensure that malware, if accidentally executed, would not escape the virtual machine?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Static Analysis questions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Open Ghidra, what do you see?
        \item Import any executable (doesn't have to be malware) into Ghidra and look at the disassembly. What are the components of the user interface?
        \item What is the file type? How do you know?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Don't forget to include screenshots.
\end{itemize}

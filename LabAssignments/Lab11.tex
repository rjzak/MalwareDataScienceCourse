\section*{Lab 11 - Regularization}
\paragraph{}Building on top of Lab 4, use \texttt{ElasticNet} and \textt{RidgeClassifier} from \textt{sklearn.linear\_model} to build new models where the model is able to reduce the number of features. Provided is an example Jupyter notebook.

\textbf{Points:} 20

\section*{Instructions}
\paragraph{}Model your efforts after the code shown in the notebook.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Load the data as a \texttt{Pandas} dataframe.
    \item Create a model: \texttt{ridge = RidgeClassifier(random\_state=1)}
    \item Train the model: \texttt{ridge.fit(training.drop('Label', axis=1), training['Label'])}
    \item Iterate over the features in the model: \texttt{for index, coef in enumerate(ridge.coef\_[0]):}
    \item Keep the features with non-zero coefficients: \texttt{if coef != 0.0000000:}
    \item Drop the columns from training and testing dataframes which aren't needed: \\ \texttt{training.drop(columnsToRemove, axis=1)}
    \item Retrain, retest the model. Note changes in performance.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Questions}
\paragraph{}In a separate document, provide your answers to the following questions. The expected format is a Word document, or similar, with a few images demonstrating your progress. The assignment will be submitted via Blackboard.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What was the highest accuracy score you were able to achieve? How was this a change?
    \item How many features were removed by the model?
    \item What troubles or difficulties did you encounter, and how did you resolve them?
    %\item What is the Rich Header?
\end{enumerate}
